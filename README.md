# mathshistory-chooser

Adds the chooser type required for the Maths History website.

The Chooser type is almost identical to flow, except it only renders a single block at a time, which helps with more complex widgets such as the BBCode editor (which is really why this widget was designed).

Requires the `chooser` widget to be added to Lektor.
