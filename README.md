# mathshistory-biographycategories

Creates the category index pages for the biographies of the Maths History
website.

Biographies can be tagged in zero or more categories, and they will then appear
on that category index page. Requires the `tags` widget to be added to Lektor
GUI - currently this must be added manually.
