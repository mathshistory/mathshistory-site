# mathshistory-biographyindex

Creates the alphabetical index pages for the biographies of the Maths History
website.

Biographies can be tagged in zero or more letters, and they will then
appear on the corresponding alphabetical index page.

Requires the `tags` widget to be added to Lektor GUI - currently this must be
added manually.
