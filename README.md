# mathshistory-search

Provides search capability to the Maths History site.

Currently this is just a dummy plugin - as the testing/preview doesn't run a search indexer, this isn't used. It simply creates the search page with some text to that effect.

In the future, this plugin will create the proper search page, as well as maybe creating data files of the pages that can be easily read by the search indexer.
