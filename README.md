# mathshistory-categoryindex

Creates the category index pages for the biographies, history topics, societies
and honours of the Maths History website. Also creates an index for these
categories.

The pages can be tagged in zero or more categories, and they will then appear on
that category index page. Requires the `tags` widget to be added to Lektor
GUI - currently this must be added manually.
