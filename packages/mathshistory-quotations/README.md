# mathshistory-quotations

Creates the quotation pages for the mathematicians of the Maths History site.

The quotations data has been combined with the mathematician biography data for
ease of editing. However it is still desired that two separate pages are built.
This plugin creates the quotations page. If the mathematician has no quotations,
then no page is created.
