# mathshistory-posters

Creates the biography poster pages for the Maths History website.

Each mathematican might have a birth and a death poster.
- If they don't have a picture, then no posters will be created
- If the day they were born on isn't known, then the birth poster won't be made
- If the day they died on isn't known, then the death poster won't be made
